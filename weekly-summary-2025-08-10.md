                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to produce a report on 
 emerging threats and countermeasures related to vehicular terrorism, 
                        and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland Security 
Vehicular Terrorism Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2025.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On January 1, 2025, a devastating vehicular terrorist 
        attack occurred on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, 
        when an assailant inspired by the Islamic State drove a vehicle 
        into a crowd and engaged in a shootout with law enforcement. 
        This tragic incident resulted in the loss of 14 lives and 
        injuries to at least thirty-five others, including two police 
        officers.
            (2) Vehicle-ramming attacks and other vehicular terrorist 
        incidents represent an enduring and evolving threat to public 
        safety in the United States and around the world, targeting 
        innocent civilians and first responders.
            (3) These attacks, carried out by both organized terrorist 
        groups and individual actors, often aim to exploit high-density 
        public gatherings, critical infrastructure, and key 
        transportation hubs, causing mass casualties and widespread 
        disruption.
            (4) Emerging automotive technologies, such as autonomous 
        vehicles, Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) 
        capabilities, and ride-sharing platforms, create new 
        vulnerabilities that could be leveraged by malicious actors to 
        conduct sophisticated vehicle-based attacks.
            (5) The Department of Homeland Security, through agencies 
        like the Transportation Security Administration and the 
        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, plays a vital 
        role in detecting, assessing, and mitigating the risks 
        associated with vehicle-based threats.
            (6) Strengthened coordination between Federal, State, 
        local, Tribal, territorial, and private sector stakeholders is 
        essential to enhance prevention, preparedness, and response 
        efforts, ensuring the safety of communities across the nation.

SEC. 3. REPORT ON EMERGING THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES RELATED TO 
              VEHICULAR TERRORISM.

    (a) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
        in coordination with the Administrator of the Transportation 
        Security Administration and the Director of the Cybersecurity 
        and Infrastructure Security Agency, shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report on the Department 
        of Homeland Securitys efforts to prevent, deter, and respond

5. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service sponsors the Red Wolf Recovery Program, dedicated to restoring the wild population of red wolves.
6. There are now 270 captive red wolves across the country thanks to the dedication and work at dozens of zoological parks and repopulation programs.

8. Recovery efforts would be impossible without the tireless work of biologists, zoologists, volunteers, and others working in the field and at repopulation programs.
9. Bipartisan action from current and recent presidential administrations has led to approvals of various programs, including wildlife corridors, aimed at protecting species such as the red wolf.
10. Wildlife corridors will be placed along Route 64 in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge to protect red wolves across eastern North Carolina.
