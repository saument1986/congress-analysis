# Congressional Bill Analysis - Weekly Summaries

**Automated plain-English analysis of significant congressional bills**

## What This Does

This project automatically analyzes recent Congressional activity and produces weekly summaries that explain:

- **What bills actually do** (beyond the political marketing)
- **Who benefits** from the legislation  
- **Real-world impact** on regular citizens
- **Current status** and next steps

## Why This Exists

Congressional bills are deliberately written in complex legal language that's hard for regular people to understand. This automation cuts through the jargon to show what our elected officials are actually voting on.

## How It Works

1. **Fetches** recent bill data from Congress.gov API
2. **Filters** for significant legislation (skips "name a post office" bills)
3. **Analyzes** bill text using AI to extract key information
4. **Generates** weekly markdown summaries in plain English
5. **Publishes** automatically to GitHub
